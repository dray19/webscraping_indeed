# webscraping_indeed
Code used to scrape indeed.com and Monster.com for data science  and financial manager skills in job listings.

“GA_indeed.ipynb” is code for scraping of top skills needed for a data scientist in 6 cities across the United States from indeed.com. “DS_results” is the count for each city in a csv file, this csv file was used to create a simple tableau dashboard. The link to the dashboard is in the “links_tableau” file.

 “Scrapping_Manager.ipynb” is code for scraping of the top skills for a financial manager in 6 cities across the United States from indeed.com. “FM_results” is the count for each city in a csv file, this csv file was used to create a simple tableau dashboard. The link to the dashboard is in the “links_tableau” file. 

“ga_indeed2.ipynb” is code for scraping of the same 6 cities as in    “Scrapping_Manager.ipynb” but in this file the goal was to look for new skills for a financial manager by counting the top single words and bigrams used in each of the 6 cities and all of the cities together.  

“DS_Monster.ipynb” is code for scraping Monster.com for data science skills. After testing the code to make sure it works, which it did and I could scrape job listings, I received an error message that my access was denied.  There may be a limit of how much you can scrape before they shut you down.
